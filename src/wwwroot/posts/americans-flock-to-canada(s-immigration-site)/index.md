not too bad an idea if you&apos;re really, really unhappy with the current state of your own country. of course, the idea of
<a>moving to canada</a>  seems all well and good right now, but let&apos;s see what happens when those very same people see the tax rates. the thing is, americans aren&apos;t accustomed to paying for what they want these days. we&apos;re so eager to take and so reluctant
to earn. it&apos;s the whole &quot;take a pill instead of drinking your orange juice (to get your vitamin c)&quot; paradigm. we want it, but we don&apos;t think we should have to do anything to get it. and keep remembering, despite what mtv says, that 1 out of every 10 young
americans put down the bong and went to the polls. they scream and yell for change but when the line&apos;s too long and they&apos;ll end up missing their favorite game show, the same whiners roll right back into their living rooms for more of the same.
