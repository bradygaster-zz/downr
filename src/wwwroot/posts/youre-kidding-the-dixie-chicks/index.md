Like, I&apos;ve never been a huge fan of the
<a>Dixie Chicks</a>  aside from their flippant disregard for Bushiness, but I have to tell you, this here press release makes me pretty excited. Rick Rubin? Whoa. That guy is like, my idol and what-not. If for no other reason than that I just might have to
purchase this album. Whoa. Me. Buying <em>country?</em>
