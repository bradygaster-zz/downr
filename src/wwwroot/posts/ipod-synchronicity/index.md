The word
<a>synchronicity</a>  was the original reason (or interest-spawn) for my major in Psychology. That&apos;s important to understand the big deal of this post. I&apos;ve basically just proven there to be a connection between the human being and a technological device.
In this case, my Ipod (named Schroeder after my favorite peanuts character, who also plays music). I&apos;m sitting at work, listening to my Ipod. I usually activate Shuffle mode while at work, so that I don&apos;t have to keep switching manually. This track comes
on that I don&apos;t recognize, but that reminds me somewhat of the lovely band
<a>Portishead</a>, one of my college favorites. Well, the track wasn&apos;t by them, but rather some other artist. The song was one of the new ones I recently copied onto Schroeder, so I just sat, worked, and listened. Then, the track ended. The next track? Portishead&apos;s
&quot;Cowboys.&quot; See? We do have a connection to the world around us. Even when that connection is made to something as synthetic as an Ipod. Update: Not withstanding the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style I tend to implement here, I felt it cautionary to mention
that I&apos;m not being <em>too</em>  serious about this. I mean, I do have a connection with my Ipod, but damn.
