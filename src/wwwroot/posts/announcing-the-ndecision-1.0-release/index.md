<p>A pet project of mine for a few months, NDecision is finally going to be allowed to see the light of day. You can get it as a
  <a>NuGet package</a>  right now.</p>

<p>If you&apos;d like to see a video of NDecision being installed and used in a brand new project, there&apos;s a video below. Finally, click the NDecision link in the navigation bar above if you&apos;d like to read more about NDecision. There&apos;s not a lot to it, but that&apos;s
  kind of the point.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Keep watching this blog and the NDecision page, though, I&apos;ve got some more stuff related to NDecision I&apos;ll be talking about in a few days. For now, grab it and start using the BDD decisioning goodness that NDecision offers!</p>
