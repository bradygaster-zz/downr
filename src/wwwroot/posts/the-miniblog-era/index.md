  <a>Mads</a>  created
  <a>MiniBlog</a>, and I liked it quite a bit. You can&apos;t argue with the very idea of MiniBlog, to keep blogging and your web server as simple as possible. I&apos;m kinda into Azure these days, so I had some ideas on&#xA0; how to make MiniBlog run better on Azure.
  So this is the first step - becoming a user of MiniBlog to learn more about the project and to contribute to it. </p>
<p>I&apos;ve been a huge fan, advocate, and support of Orchard for years. Orchard&apos;s a fantastic blogging tool, and my switching is no indication of my lack of love for Orchard. Orchard, to me, is one of those amazing CMS systems that you can make do anything.
  I chose to use it as a blog, and to be honest it may&apos;ve been overkill in a few places over the years but I stuck with it because I really <em>enjoy</em>  using Orchard. The truth is, I think MiniBlog is neat and I&apos;m teammates with Mads so we decided
  we&apos;d tinker and see what we could make it do. The first place to start is to
  <a>dogfood</a>  it, so that&apos;s where this post comes in. </p>
