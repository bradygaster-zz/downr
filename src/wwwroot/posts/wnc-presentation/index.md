<p>I had a great time last night speaking on [what I call] composite web application development in Asheville, NC last night. Thanks a lot to the group for allowing me the opportunity to provide the presentation. Hope you guys got some inspiration from it
  and that it&apos;ll aid in your development efforts in the future! I&apos;ve zipped up
  <a>the code and the presentation, so get it here</a>  if you&apos;re interested.</p>
