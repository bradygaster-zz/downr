swatch proposed its own version of a universal time format some years back. no link for that in this post (feeling lazy and underachiever-ish today), but a very interesting
<a>fellow has proposed a new yearly calendar</a> . i think his idea of &quot;newton week&quot; sounds pretty cool, but the idea of a sunday Christmas every year sucks - we&apos;ll always have one less day of holiday time. suckage. other than that, a fabulous idea. (i do
wonder and will attempt calculation at some point today to determine the day of the week that my birthday - halloween - will always faill upon)
