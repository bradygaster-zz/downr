<p>If you attended my SignalR talk at Codemash, thank you so much for your time. I had a blast at Codemash, and really enjoyed the talk. It was a great audience with some good conversations in the hallway afterward. If you attended the session and want to
  get your hands on the deck and code, this is the place.&#xA0;</p>
<p>
  <a>The deck and code are here</a> !</p>
<p>Safe travels home, everyone! I look forward to next year&apos;s Codemash!</p>
