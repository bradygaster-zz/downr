This new server-side.net article,
<a>Visual Studio vs. Vista: What&apos;s going on here?</a>, raises an interesting question. The quote &quot;Ensuring that VS2005 works well on Windows Vista is a core goal of ours. Visual Studio 2005 SP1 will run on Vista but will likely have a few compatibility issues.
We are working with the Vista team to understand those, to provide workarounds where possible and also work on providing you with a set of fixes beyond SP1&quot; makes me wonder - at Microsoft, it seems like one hand has ripped off the other one and beaten
the owner to a blood pulp. Guys, get your sh17 straight.
