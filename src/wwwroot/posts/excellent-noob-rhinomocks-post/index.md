<p>Buddy, the Beginnermediate developer (I love that tagline BTW) has written an
  <a>excellent blog post on Rhino Mocks</a> . For someone like myself who understands TDD, implements it at a &quot;B-minus&quot; level and who thinks that mocks could help but have no idea how to get started, this post is a must-read. I can&apos;t wait to download RM now
  and get started. Excellent work!</p>
