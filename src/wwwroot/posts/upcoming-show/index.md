i don&apos;t talk too much about music on my site. if i did, chances are i wouldn&apos;t have time to get much else done aside from talking about music. i listen to it, hear about it from gina, who hears about it from her brother, play it, read about it, read what
others are saying about it, and on and on. anyway, this weekend we&apos;re going to go see a band i&apos;ve recently gotten into called the
<a>the Kings of Leon</a> . If you don&apos;t know about them yet, check them out whatever you do. If you think you&apos;ve heard them, you might be right, because they&apos;re becoming popular quickly (maybe a result of doing the cute VW commercial soundtrack with the young
indie couple hopping up and down in their new house, which they bought for fear of murderous neighbors). I have no complaints whatsoever about the group and can&apos;t even describe how excited I am about the show, which we&apos;ll be seeing in lovely Asheville,
NC (close to where we got hitched, and across the street from where our after-party was hosted). Something about the way the lead singer sings their relatively
<a>interesting lyrics</a>  snatched me when I first heard them. Maybe its in the way the guy mumbles (I mumble most of the time so I dig it when I hear other people mumbling, especially when they&apos;re famous). Anyway, its what&apos;s playing now, so listen to it.
