<p>The best part of my job as a Technical Evangelist is working with the community members. Hands down, this is the best way for any evangelist to learn about their product and how it is being used in the wild. The Azure community is a great one, with huge
  technical depth and experience, and it is my honor to be working on a great community event that highlights what real developers are doing with Azure. I&#x2019;d like to introduce you to Windows AzureConf, the first all-community Azure event executed by the
  community at Channel 9 Studios.</p>
<p>On November 14, 2012, Microsoft will be hosting
  <a>Windows AzureConf</a>, a free event for the
  <a>Azure</a>  community. This event will feature a keynote presentation by
  <a>Scott Guthrie</a>, along with numerous sessions executed by Azure community members. Streamed live for an online audience on
  <a>Channel 9</a>, the event will allow you to see how developers just like you are using Azure to develop applications on the best cloud platform in the industry. Community members from all over the world will join Scott in the Channel 9 studios to present
  their own ideas, innovations inventions and experiences. These presentations will provide you the opportunity to see how your peers in the community are doing great things using Azure offerings like Mobile Services, Web Sites, Service Bus, virtual machines,
  and more. Whether you&#x2019;re just learning
  <a>Azure</a>  or you&#x2019;ve already achieved success on the platform, you won&#x2019;t want to miss this special event. For more information on Windows AzureConf or to register for the event, please visit
  <a>http://windowsazureconf.net</a> .</p>
<p>Some great
  <a>community members</a>  will be participating in the event, and they&#x2019;ve got some mind-blowing
  <a>sessions</a>  lined up that demonstrate everything from attaching the
  <a>Netduino</a>  microcontroller to Azure, to writing your very own Windows 8 application that uses Azure as a data-storage layer or middle tier.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re wondering how you can roll Azure into your own enterprise, or if you&#x2019;re a startup wondering how it can help you bootstrap your young business, Windows AzureConf is for you. You&#x2019;ll see how other community members are making use of Azure to be
  more successful than ever, and how they&#x2019;re solving real-world problems by using cloud computing.</p>
